# Ideas
- Inbox (for things to read, watch, write)
  - The agent should help me **learn**. Like, it should ask me questions about what I understood, how it fits in the overall picture... Have clear input/outputs to the content in the inbox: why is it here? what’s the learning? should we get more or less of these in the future?
  - The agent should recommend we pieces of writing based on what I read, liked, topics that interest me, sources I enjoy...
  - The agent should scout the Internet to find articles I might like and keep me up to date
- Charles had an interesting point to frame the product with LLMs at the center. Traditional software is build around this idea that you write code/data model to do stuff. Maybe today, an LLM assisted with traditional software can yield better products. For example, a model that can access structured data on me.
