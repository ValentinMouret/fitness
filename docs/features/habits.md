# Habits
## Overview
Habits are a great way to create «discipline».

As a user, I want to be able to create habits, starting at a given date, with a given frequency.

I should be able to track my progress and see how my habits are affecting my life.
Am I on a streak? Are there any patterns?

I should also be able to log notes on the habit.
